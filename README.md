# Roster Scraper ![Python Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
Web scraping tool that scrapes a website for tables and allows you to select and trim up the one table that you want.

# Usage
I created a quick usage video. Currently the app is limited in scope but you can scrape tables from websites and make excel sheets out of them

# Future Development and Background
I am going to polish and refactor this app so it is easily maintanable and expandable in the future.
