# Roster Scraper ![Python Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
Web scraping tool that scrapes a website for tables and allows you to select and trim up the one table that you want.

# Usage
I created a quick usage video. Currently the app is limited in scope but you can scrape tables from websites and make excel sheets out of them

# Future Development and Background
I am going to polish and refactor this app so it is easily maintainable and expandable in the future.

# Reason for making this
I haven't made a "true" desktop app before so I wanted to get experience. I have made PWA's, several command line apps, and C++ apps with graphics using SFML, but never a desktop app that was really made to do something like this. Technically, the C++ stuff counts but I don't know how much I count it personally since it was for class and we had a great teacher that gave us a lot of direction.
